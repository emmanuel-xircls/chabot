        "responses": "SMS Packs are required if you wish to send Loyalty Offers and partner offers to your customers via SMS. If your business is a website or mobile app, offers are sent via email to your customers by default. In this case, SMS Packs are not compulsory but still highly recommended. However, if you're a physical, offline outlet such as a store, restaurant, gym, etc., do not collect email addresses of customers and wish to deliver offers to your customers against their mobile number, offer delivery via SMS is the only option. In such a case, purchase of SMS Packs becomes mandatory.",
